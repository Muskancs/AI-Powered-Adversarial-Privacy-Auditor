# 🔒 Adversarial Privacy Auditing Framework

This repository contains the implementation of a **comprehensive adversary-aware privacy auditing framework**.  
The framework integrates **classical anonymization**, **differential privacy**, **adversarial attack simulations**, and a **conversational AI assistant** to help researchers, practitioners, and policymakers evaluate privacy risks while maintaining data utility.  

---

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ **Anonymization Techniques** – k-anonymity, l-diversity, t-closeness, and differential privacy  
- ✅ **Adversarial Testing** – Membership Inference Attacks (MIA), Attribute Inference Attacks (AIA), and Reconstruction attacks  
- ✅ **Privacy–Utility Trade-off Analysis** – Measure re-identification risk vs. dataset usability  
- ✅ **Conversational AI Assistant** – Interactive chatbot for guidance and explanation of privacy outcomes  
- ✅ **Modular Design** – Easy to extend with new datasets, anonymization methods, or attack models

⚙️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/privacy-auditor.git
cd privacy-auditor


2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows


3. Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

🧪 Usage

Run experiments on sample datasets:

python src/main.py --dataset data/military.csv --method k-anonymity --k 5


Run adversarial simulations:

python src/main.py --dataset data/bank.csv --attack mia


Launch the chatbot assistant:

python src/chatbot/app.py

📊 Example Results (Table 7.1)

The framework was tested across multiple datasets. The results demonstrate how anonymization and adversarial testing reduce risks while maintaining data utility.

| Metric                        | Military | Bank   | Medical |
|--------------------------------|----------|--------|---------|
| Raw Overall Risk (0–100)       | 3.50     | 68.21  | 29.46   |
| Anonymized Overall Risk (0–100)| 0.55     | 18.38  | 0.13    |
| MIA Accuracy (Raw)             | 0.373    | 0.830  | 0.859   |
| MIA Accuracy (Anon)            | 0.007    | 0.599  | 0.000   |

✅ This is a single **ready-to-use README**.  

Do you also want me to generate a **requirements.txt** with pinned versions so anyone can just install and run the repo without dependency errors?
